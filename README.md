### A philosophical resource for the modern man

I'm a lover, enthusiast and student of Philosophy, and up until now, there has been no online resource for me to search and understand philosophical debate, arguments and key terms. Any online resource is confusing, complicated, incomplete and full of waffle and difficult to understand. This website is an attempt to solve this problem.

## Goals

* **Readability.** Key terms should be explained simply inline. Arguments for and against should be explained clearly and succinctly.
* **Revise-ability.** Key philosophical concepts should be accompanied by short summaries and short lists of important information to help revision.
* **Illustration-ability.** Things should be explained clearly with examples, and, ideally, multi-media teaching resources like video.
