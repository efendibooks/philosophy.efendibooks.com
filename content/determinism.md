# Determinism

Determinism is a philisophy (as well as a set of arguments) that states **for everything that happens there are conditions, and, given those exact conditions, nothing else could have happened.** There are different versions of determinism with different approaches and different definitions of 'conditions', but, on the whole, they are all similarly agreed: **an event that occurs is the result of pre-existing conditions**.

Ultimately, the purpose of discussing determinism is to figure out if human beings are accountable for their actions or not... if they've got free will and if they're able to control their own movements and decisions. It's a little more complex than that, but we'll get onto that later.

## Causal Determinism

Causal determinism[^1] - not _casual_ determinism! - is the basic idea of cause and effect. It's the idea that at any point in time, the existing state - where and how things are, what positions they're in, if they're cold, hot, hungry, angry, whatever - is completely the result of a previous state.

This makes a lot of sense. If I am hungry, it's probably because it's 4:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday and I've not eaten yet. The state of me being hungry is _determined_ because of my previous state of not eating.

Causal determinism is stating that we can explain every action from the previous state the world was in; that every movement and decision made by a person is the result of what state they were in before. Make sense?

A good way of thinking about some of the following arguments is the **Supercomputer Theory by Pierre-Simon Laplace**. It is the idea that every action in the world is the consequence of a supercomputer that contains every piece of information about every atom in the universe. Simply plug in the conditions and cause of an action and the computer returns a unique effect.

### Arguments For

Let's look at some arguments in favour of causal determinism:

#### Physically causal determinism

This argument comes from the physics idea of _conservation of energy_. According to the _conservation of energy_ hypothesis, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transfered from thing to thing. This means that, in the physical world, any movement of any thing can be explained and accounted for by pre-determined physical conditions.

For philosophers, this means we can explain a human's decision through the preceeding physical, mechanical conditions of the body and brain, without needing to refer to the individual's intents or purposes. Like in my previous lunch example, **I didn't choose to eat lunch because I wanted to, my body decided for me.**

Physicists justify this by stating: **if an act of free will, which is a mental, non-physical decision, caused an act of the body, which is a physical thing bound by physical law, the physical energy of the world would increase.** This contradicts the conservation of energy hypothesis, which states that energy cannot be created. Since an abstract thought can't have physical energy, we can't transfer it, and therefore, an _act of will_ can't cause an _act of the body_.

#### Biologically causal determinism

There's an argument from biology, to. This is closest to the idea of **nature/nurture**: we are born with certain aspects of ourselves defined from our genetics, hereditarily, and the others from our environment.

This argument states that any create is a mixture of **capacities**[^2] and **reactions to stimuli**. The capacities it gets from heredity... we inheret certain aspects of ourselves. The reactions to stimuli come from the environment in which we reside. Our decisions are therefore determined by two factors: **our abilities to do something** and **our reactions to the world around us**.

#### The Law of Causation

This one's funny. Causation, as we've been talking about, is the simple idea of cause and effect. Nobody can deny this: **every effect has a cause and every action has a reaction**. Philosophers can therefore use this law as an argument for causal determinism.

Effects have causes. The effect is like the cause; it is, in fact, the cause transformed. Much like how a bolt of lightening is the _transformation_ of the preceeding electricity in the cloud, the physical effect of a human's action is the transformation of the preceeding physical cause. So, therefore, a man's will doesn't count for anything.

#### Sociologically causal determinism

One interesting interpretation of determinism is from sociology. Sociology is the study of the structure of human society, and their argument takes the question of determinism and free-will out from the individual and instead puts it in the **context of society as a whole**.

This argument states that we're predetermined because of our position and experience in society. The members of a crowd aren't freely deciding, they're following the leader. The leader isn't freely deciding, he's following some idea in his mind. So, a person's decisions are traceable to **the deeds of others and his individual ideas**, and that _these_ are the driving forces behind determinism.

This argument becomes _really_ interesting when you look at statistics, and in particular, how an action that would be considered to be free will is actually predictable when in the context of society as a whole.

An example: a man decides to get married. He loves his significant other very much and wants to spend the rest of his life with them. This is totally his action, right? He decides to out of his own free will and accord.

BUT... many others do the same. **And statisticians can highly accurately predict, in advance, the number of marriages that are going to take place on a year-by-year basis**. Was it not pre-determined then, in this society, that that certain number of marriages would occur?

If these figures are predictable, then, surely they can't be acts of free will? Viewed at a high level, at the level of society rather than the level of the individual, acts of free will appear to be governed by general laws, and are thus determined in some way.

#### Ethical Argument

Many people view the idea of freedom as an interest of ethics: a man's duty, obligation, conscience, reward and blame. There is also an argument from the ethical camp for determinism.

The argument is: a man's character determines his acts, and he is responsible for the act he just committed. He committed it because he is the way he is, and **being the man he is could not have done otherwise**.

If his act were one of free will, he wouldn't be dependable. **Because he is bound by his character**, he _is_ dependable. If his acts are good, he is praised; if his acts are bad, he is pitied. **He is rewarded when doing good in order to keep his character stable, and he is punished when doing bad to help him do good next time.**

It's certainly less concrete than the others, but is an interesting argument nonetheless.

### Arguments Against

Now for some arguments against causal determinism.

#### Determinism is bad science

One frequently cited argument against determinism is that it is bad science. While the arguments above from physics and biology make sense, **they don't apply at a quantum level**.

From what little we know about quantum mechanics, we do know that the behaviour of certain sub-atomic particles **is impossible to predict.** A clever bloke called **Werner Heisenberg** discovered that it is impossible to accurately measure the momentum and position of an electron. This means that particles at a quantum level **really do behave without a cause**. Surely the existence of an unpredictable element disproves any argument for determinism? If the world really is determined, then these elements should be determinable.

A counter-argument to this would be that **this doesn't disprove determinism, it just makes the world impossible to predict.** Our scientific ability right now to observe and measure particles at a sub-atomic level is clearly not sophisticated enough just yet to truly understand what's going on with Quantum Indeterminancy... but that doesn't refute the argument of determinism in of itself.

An even better counter-argument is that, scientifically, the movement of an atom is the result of **external forces**. In other words, the sub-atomic level is **irrelevant for the movement of the atom as a whole**, and, since external forces _are_ things we can measure and predict, the world could still be determined.

[^1]: Causal rhymes with 'morsal'. Sort of. Causal, because it's about _causes_. Not casual, like, casually chilling on the sofa. Got it?

[^2]: A **capacity** is the ability or power to do, experience or understand something. In this context it's talking about our abilities, talents and the physical world governing us.
