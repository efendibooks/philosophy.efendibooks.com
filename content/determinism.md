# Determinism

Determinism is a philisophy that states **for everything that happens there are conditions, and, given those exact conditions, nothing else could have happened.** There are different versions of determinism with different approaches and different definitions of 'conditions', but, on the whole, they are all similarly agreed: **an event that occurs is the result of pre-existing conditions**.

Ultimately, the purpose of discussing determinism is to figure out if human beings are accountable for their actions or not... if they've got free will and if they're able to control their own movements and decisions. It's a little more complex than that, but we'll get onto that later.

## Causal Determinism

Causal determinism[^1] - not _casual_ determinism! - is the basic idea of cause and effect. It's the idea that at any point in time, the existing state - where and how things are, what positions they're in, if they're cold, hot, hungry, angry, whatever - is completely the result of a previous state.

This makes a lot of sense. If I am hungry, it's probably because it's 4:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday and I've not eaten yet. The state of me being hungry is _determined_ because of my previous state of not eating.

Causal determinism is stating that we can explain every action from the previous state the world was in; that every movement and decision made by a person is the result of what state they were in before. Make sense?

### Arguments For

Let's look at some arguments in favour of causal determinism:

#### Physics

This argument comes from the physics idea of _conservation of energy_. According to the _conservation of energy_ hypothesis, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transfered from thing to thing. This means that, in the physical world, any movement of any thing can be explained and accounted for by pre-determined physical conditions.

For philosophers, this means we can explain a human's decision through the preceeding physical, mechanical conditions of the body and brain, without needing to refer to the individual's intents or purposes. Like in my previous lunch example, **I didn't choose to eat lunch because I wanted to, my body decided for me.**

Physicists justify this by stating: **if an act of free will, which is a mental, non-physical decision, caused an act of the body, which is a physical thing bound by physical law, the physical energy of the world would increase.** This contradicts the conservation of energy hypothesis, which states that energy cannot be created. Since an abstract thought can't have physical energy, we can't transfer it, and therefore, an _act of will_ can't cause an _act of the body_.

#### Biology

There's an argument from biology, to. This is closest to the idea of **nature/nurture**: we are born with certain aspects of ourselves defined from our genetics, hereditarily, and the others from our environment.

This argument states that any create is a mixture of **capacities**[^2] and **reactions to stimuli**. The capacities it gets from heredity... we inheret certain aspects of ourselves. The reactions to stimuli come from the environment in which we reside. Our decisions are therefore determined by two factors: **our abilities to do something** and **our reactions to the world around us**.

[^1]: Causal rhymes with 'morsal'. Sort of. Causal, because it's about _causes_. Not casual, like, casually chilling on the sofa. Got it?
[^2]: A **capacity** is the ability or power to do, experience or understand something. In this context it's talking about our abilities, talents and the physical world governing us.
